Anne lost control and laughed
Billy wrote on the envelope
He called over his shoulder
He stayed against the wall
Helen ran to the toilet
I cannot tell you more
Michael gave Adam two pounds
Roger smiled and sat down
Things were looking up again
This man's hair is black
Turn your hearing aid up
You'll demand nothing of me
A horse has thrown a shoe
A tube train took his legs
Five will be listening for sure
Gordon felt his anger build up
Harry smiled at his little brother
He needed putting in his place
He shouted and the calling ceased
He uses his belt on you
He's broken his wrists very badly
I am touched deeply in places
I don't want to hear it
I knew I heard your voice
I wouldn't want to miss this
Jack walked up to the door
Ross sat back down and shivered
She couldn't help feel for Alex
The bored looking soldier just pointed
The campaign will pay for itself
They're riding out to meet them
We barely escaped with our lives
We've been travelling almost three days
Alice is looking for somewhere to live
Alan forgot to shave again this morning
Have a carriage sent for us immediately
He probably doesn't want people to know
He put the fork on the table
I'll give him more than a slap
Andrew nodded and stood against the counter
Looks like a walk did the trick
Sam felt proud when he went home
Scott got up and washed his plate
Simon nodded and walked into the room
Steve sat down to eat his lunch
Ted smiled and bit his bottom lip
Thomas stepped back and shook his head
Tom stood up and wiped his jeans
Tony stopped off at his first delivery
Normally they want to cut things up
Powerful in the wrong hands, is that
She had refused to leave her home
She hid the boxes and matches well
The bored looking soldier continued looking bored
The dead must not kill the living
The prison guard walked along the row
The van is your lead, follow that
You're getting up early in the morning
After lunch he was told he had visitors
Albert spoke before Barbara had a chance to
Come within the walls to escape the enemy
Follow me closely and watch for their leader
He called out but she did not move
He sat down and began to eat breakfast
He slammed the knife down on the lamb
He staggered into the chair at his desk
I do not spare the birds a killing
I think our friend's demands are well justified
Let us leave these poor people in peace
Walter closed the door and took a breath
William sat down and tucked into his breakfast
Alec stood against the wall to steady himself
No-one else had dared step within the ring
None of the city people dress like that
She saw the throwing knife in his hand
She was smiling in the dark, teeth flashing
Shut your smart foul mouth and sit down
Tell me what really happened to the truck
The door was opened and Alexander walked out
There were choked screams and shouts of dismay
There will be men to kill either way
They were definitely holding hands underneath the table
Claudia still teaches and still claims to hate it
Burn him now, don't wait for him to escape
Don't die of cold before you die in battle
Good God, if you are watching, give me strength
He heaved his shoulders and swung the axe again
He is after glory and heads for his hall
He just wished he could talk to his dad
He lay his sword aside and extended his hands
He sighed and walked back to the wood shop
He smiled when she let out a big yawn
He was leaning against his truck smoking a joint
I was thinking of getting the band together again
It is a narrow ship, much like our own
Arthur placed the bars of chocolate on the counter
John gave Bernard a hard slap on the head
Let's get out and I'll buy you a drink
Let's have the gates closed and go home early
Andrew closed the office door on the way out
Charles felt sick to the pit of his stomach
Christopher groaned and lay his hands across his stomach
Dave kicked him in the stomach and Paul groaned
Dexter opened his letter and found a photograph inside
Duncan took a breath and wanted to be sick
Edward washed his hands and flicked water at Bob
She turned and saw him standing in her path
They turned round just as Frankie walked toward them
Underneath the table her hand was gripping the chair
Whether Peter heard him or not Gabriel didn't care
You give me a lead and I'll follow it
All the bowls from the empty tables are cleared up
His dark hair was just visible under his white hat
His men will not follow him and they are few
I'll break your neck if you don't fix that water
Ian gave Geoffrey a hard slap across his right ear
Jake smiled again at his baby daughter, she was perfect
Jimmy liked the fact they were calling him Jim
Brian sniffed and wiped his grubby hand across his nose
Phil let him go and Charlie fell to the ground
Let me through and you'll hear nothing more of it
Men could be paid to do all sorts of things
Gilbert sat as still as he could nursing his lip
Jacques sighed and tried to move out of the way
Jamie took a cigarette and Andy gave him a light
Joseph walked into the office and removed his flat cap
She would soon be found if she tried to hide
The brothers stood up and came down from the platform
Anthony was approached, just as he had predicted, in the park
Despite what Frank had told her Ellen thanked the young soldier
He called earlier and I already arranged to go swimming tomorrow
He drove his truck home and walked down to the village
He held his mother tight and she cried into his chest
He went to the door and walked out of the room
His helmet was lost but he could still do some damage
Ken just hoped he wasn't taking his temper out on Chris
Lawrence rubbed the back of his neck and hung his head
Lewis sat down and Lucy laid her hand on his cheek
Matthew stood against the wall with his hands behind his back
Run along home now and bring us some men to kill
She just kept telling herself he had to learn a lesson
She wound up talking to Barry about her time in India
The gate was double, one huge mass of wood following another
The gathered villagers took a step back, almost as one man
We shall arrive properly or you will never live this down
While they sat drinking their tea, Mick dug them a trench
You know better than to talk to your mother like that
You know that I will do whatever you ask of me
You shouldn't have been racing my truck in the first place
A smile came to his lips as he thought of an idea
All last week there was a white van parked across the street
Finally Maria sat down with a cup of tea and a sandwich
He didn't seem to mind that she was screaming in his ear
He drank too much at times and washed too little at times
He folded his arms across his chest and put out his lip
He had another shock when they told him he was moving cells
He put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the truck
He was built with muscle and liked to throw his weight around
I am trying, old man, but I would rather kill the ship
I shall have a victory and I want it to be remembered
In the morning Mickey stood straight with his hand behind his back
In the morning at breakfast Mike smiled at the letter he received
It had been two weeks since Philip had been sent to prison
It is not the most fragrant of places but we make do
James walked in to wake Samuel at four thirty in the morning
Let us give battle to these foreign snakes once and for all
Tommy came out of the staff room toilet looking a little pale
Michael knew they never hit him and that was half the problem
Alan told Jason he would just sit outside to have his lunch
Now the man is coming who will give it back to me
She threatened to leave before and this time she just had enough
The first knife caught in her skirt and she shook it free
The last thing Alex felt like doing after work was more work
The truck was an older version of the ones the others drove
They stared at the black wall and now this offered no comfort
We should talk about the things people talk about on first dates
Why don't you tell me what happened on Saturday, step by step
Emma put her mug of tea down on the table with a bang
Bruce is looking for someone to take the spare room in his flat
From the moment we leave this spot be very careful what you say
He knocked on the door so hard that he almost broke it down
He let Donald go and he fell to the floor with a thud
He smiled again and felt like a man and not just the kid
He's got the ability to work but he just gets bored too easy
I can't see any amount of talk getting you out of this mess
I flung out my hands and they said I had broken my wrists
I mostly just pick a dry white and drink it to get drunk
Andy felt good when he got ready to go out on Saturday night
Billy knocked on the door and waited till he was told to enter
Bob sat at the entrance to the warehouse and made up a cigarette
Brian sat down at an empty table and began to eat his breakfast
One by one she placed her teeth about their necks and killed them
The shout caught him off guard and he fell back a little way
He rose from his seat and stopped mid way when Joe glared at him
He sat his son up on the table and laid his belt beside him
If I have time at the end I'll fill you in on what happened
Henry washed his hands and sat on the seat in front of the stove
The police officer got out of the van and picked up the two cans
The speaker turned to her with a smile and a bow of his head
They say he can breathe fire and kill a man with a single word
He came back to his senses when he heard his dad stand up to him
He was already up and dressed and invited us in for a cup of tea
I know Richard drinks a little too much and has a bit of a temper
If this were a movie instead of a book this would be a good bit
James was only in the cell for an hour but it felt like a week
